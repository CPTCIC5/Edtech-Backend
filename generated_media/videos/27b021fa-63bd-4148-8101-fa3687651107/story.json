She began working at NASA during World War II, a time when all calculations were done manually by a team of \"human computers.\" Despite the era's racial segregation, she excelled at the Langley Research Center and became the first African-American woman to be promoted as a head of personnel. She led the West Area Computing unit, which was composed of African-American women. With the introduction of electronic computers, Dorothy saw the potential and importance of computers in scientific research. She became proficient in FORTRAN, one of the earliest programming languages, and taught many others as well. Her work laid the foundation for future generations of women and minorities in STEM fields.","story_annotated":"1.
