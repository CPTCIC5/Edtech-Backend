In June 1969, a pivotal moment in LGBTQ history unfolded outside the Stonewall Inn, a humble bar in New York City. This establishment served as a sanctuary for many in the community, offering them a place to freely express themselves. However, one fateful night would see the Stonewall Inn become the heart of a significant battle for equality. It was June 28th when police raided the Inn, targeting its patrons as they had done many times before, sparking outrage and defiance. The crowd outside, growing in numbers and determination, became a symbol of unity and resistance. Protestors, filled with a sense of empowerment, raised signs and chanted calls for freedom and justice. This fierce display of courage amidst the tense night air marked the beginning of a vibrant movement towards LGBTQ rights.
