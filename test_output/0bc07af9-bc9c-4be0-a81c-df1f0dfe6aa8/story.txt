In this video, we will delve into the remarkable stories of pioneering women in science during the 20th century. This era was marked by significant scientific advancements, many of which were contributed by women who challenged societal norms and broke through glass ceilings to make their mark on the scientific world. 

Marie Curie, a Polish-born physicist and chemist, stands out among these trailblazers. Curie conducted groundbreaking research in radioactivityâ€”a term she coined. Despite facing considerable biases, she became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and she remains the only woman to win in multiple sciences, cementing her legacy as a trailblazer in her field. 

Another monumental figure is Rosalind Franklin, whose extensive work with X-ray diffraction led to the understanding of the DNA double-helix structure. While her contributions were crucial, she faced significant recognition challenges, partly due to her gender and her untimely death. 

Chien-Shiung Wu, a Chinese-American physicist, made pivotal contributions to the field of nuclear physics. Her experiments revolutionized the understanding of particle physics, particularly through her work that demonstrated the violation of the conservation of parity. Although her contributions were essential, Wu contended with the complexities of identity in the sciences, both as a woman and as a Chinese immigrant. 

These women, among others, have inspired generations, proving that talent and perseverance can lead to groundbreaking achievements regardless of the barriers one faces.
