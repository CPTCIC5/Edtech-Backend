Women in science during the 20th century faced numerous societal constraints, yet significantly reshaped our understanding of the world. Pioneers such as Marie Curie, who won Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry, paved the way with her research on radioactivity, leading to advancements in medical technologies like X-ray surgery. In the mid-century, Rosalind Franklin's X-ray diffraction work critically contributed to the discovery of the DNA structure. Meanwhile, physicist Chien-Shiung Wu played a key role in nuclear research, contradicting established physical laws yet faced significant recognition challenges despite her contributions. These women overcame biases and laid the groundwork for future scientific endeavors, reminding us of the essential role diversity plays in progress.
