The 20th century was a transformative period in history where women made remarkable contributions to the world of science. At the forefront was Marie Curie, a pioneering physicist and chemist who became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the only individual to win in two different sciences: Physics and Chemistry. Her work on radioactivity laid the foundation for significant advancements in medical treatments and nuclear physics. Another key figure was Rosalind Franklin, an accomplished chemist whose X-ray diffraction images were crucial in revealing DNA's double helix structure. Despite her work being overlooked for many years, her contributions to genetics have been recognized posthumously. Katherine Johnson was another trailblazer, whose precise calculations at NASA significantly contributed to the success of the first U.S. manned spaceflights. She navigated racial and gender barriers to achieve recognition for her exceptional computational skills. These trailblazing women and many others inspired future generations by breaking stereotypes and establishing a legacy that encourages young women to pursue science. Today, women continue to drive innovation and discovery in various scientific disciplines.
