The 20th century marked a transformative era for women in science, as they broke barriers and made groundbreaking contributions. From Marie Curie's monumental achievements in radioactivity, which opened new medical frontiers, to Rosalind Franklin's pivotal role in discovering DNA's structure; these women laid the groundwork for future innovations. Dorothy Hodgkin's advancements in understanding molecular structures through X-ray crystallography revolutionized biochemistry, and Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin's insights on stellar compositions changed the field of astrophysics. These pioneers not only advanced their fields but also inspired future generations of women to pursue careers in science, overcoming gender-based challenges and contributing significantly to the world's scientific knowledge.
