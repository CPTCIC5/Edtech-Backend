In the 20th century, many brilliant female minds emerged in science despite societal barriers. Marie Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, revolutionized our understanding of radioactivity. Rosalind Franklin's pivotal work on DNA structure was largely unrecognized in her lifetime, reflecting the era's gender inequalities. Dorothy Hodgkin's significant biochemical discoveries earned her a Nobel Prize. These women and others defied stereotypes, paving the way for future generations and highlighting the importance of diversity in STEM fields.
